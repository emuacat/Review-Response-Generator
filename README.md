# Review Response Generator

Review Response Generator is an application that generates personalized email responses to customer reviews. It leverages OpenAI's powerful language models to recognize patterns in text and create human-like responses.

## Overview

The main idea behind this application is to automate customer engagement by responding to product or service reviews. By providing previous review-email pairs, the model understands the relationship between a review and the corresponding email response. It then generates a similar response for a new review.

## How It Works

1. **Define the Format**: The input prompt and the responses are formatted using `iPrefix`, `iSuffix`, and `oPrefix` to standardize the introduction and conclusion.

2. **Provide Examples**: Example reviews and corresponding email responses are combined using the defined format to form a single string.

3. **Use OpenAI's Engine**: The concatenated string is sent as a prompt to OpenAI's engine, which generates a personalized email response, continuing the pattern established by the previous review-email pairs.

## Code Usage

The core code snippet for generating an email response is as follows:

```python
text = flow + iPrefix + review + iSuffix + oPrefix
response = openai.Completion.create(engine=engine,prompt=text,
                                    temperature=0.7,
                                    max_tokens=max_tok,
                                    top_p=1,
                                    frequency_penalty=0,
                                    presence_penalty=0,
                                    stop=["Time Store"]
                                    )
print(response["choices"][0]["text"])
